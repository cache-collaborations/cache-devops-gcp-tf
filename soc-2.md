# SOC 2 Compliance Documentation

This document outlines the measures implemented in our infrastructure to ensure SOC 2 compliance.

## SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria Addressed

### Security
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation, private subnets, network policies
- **Access Control**: IAM with least privilege, service account separation
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit encryption
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all modifications

### Availability
- **Redundancy**: Multi-node GKE clusters, replicated databases
- **Monitoring**: Alerting on critical metrics and logs
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backups with retention policies

### Processing Integrity
- **CI/CD Verification**: Tests run before deployment
- **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validated
- **Change Management**: Infrastructure as code, peer reviews

### Confidentiality
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive data identified and protected
- **Secret Management**: Google Secret Manager with strict access controls
- **Data Access**: Audit logs for all data access events

### Privacy
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data collected
- **Retention Policies**: Data stored only as long as necessary

## Audit Logging Configuration

This infrastructure implements comprehensive audit logging:

1. **Admin Activity Logs**: All administrative changes (IAM, resource creation/deletion)
2. **Data Access Logs**: All access to sensitive data
3. **System Event Logs**: System-level events
4. **Custom Metrics**: Security-focused metrics for IAM changes, network changes, etc.

## Access Control

1. **Service Account Segregation**:
   - GKE Node Service Account: Minimal permissions for node operation
   - Application Service Account: Limited to required app functions
   - Monitoring Service Account: Isolated for monitoring functions

2. **Workload Identity**: Secure authentication without using service account keys

3. **Custom Roles**: Principle of least privilege enforced through custom IAM roles

## Monitoring and Alerting

Real-time alerts configured for:
- Unauthorized IAM changes
- Network configuration changes
- Authentication failures
- Unusual data access patterns

## Retention and Encryption

- Audit logs retained for 90 days with automatic archiving
- Customer data encrypted at rest using Cloud KMS keys
- All data in transit encrypted using TLS 1.2+

## Incident Response

Automated notifications to the security team for critical events via:
- Email alerts
- Slack notifications
- PagerDuty escalations

## Compliance Testing

- Regular security scans using Google Security Command Center
- Penetration testing performed quarterly
- Compliance verification using automated checks
