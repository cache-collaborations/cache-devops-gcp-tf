# SOC 2 Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines how our infrastructure implements controls to meet SOC 2 compliance requirements across all five Trust Services Criteria:

1. Security
2. Availability
3. Processing Integrity
4. Confidentiality
5. Privacy

## Security Controls

### Access Control

- **Least Privilege**: All IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege, granting only permissions necessary for each function
- **Service Account Separation**: Dedicated service accounts for different components (GKE, application, database, audit)
- **Workload Identity**: Secure authentication without using service account keys
- **Two-factor Authentication**: Required for all administrative access

### Infrastructure Protection

- **Network Segmentation**: VPC with separate subnets for staging and production
- **Private Clusters**: GKE clusters with private nodes accessible only through bastion
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive firewall policies allowing only necessary traffic
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted both at rest and in transit

### Audit Logging

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Logging of all administrative actions, data access, and system events
- **Log Retention**: Audit logs retained for 365 days in compliant storage with encryption
- **Log Integrity**: Immutable logs with controlled access
- **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for suspicious activities

## Availability Controls

- **Redundancy**: Application deployed with multiple replicas across multiple zones
- **Automated Scaling**: HorizontalPodAutoscaler maintains performance during load changes
- **Resilient Data Storage**: Cloud SQL with automatic backups and point-in-time recovery
- **Monitoring**: Proactive monitoring of all system components with alerts

## Processing Integrity Controls

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment with proper validation
- **Input Validation**: Application validates all inputs before processing
- **Environment Separation**: Distinct staging and production environments
- **Database Integrity**: Enforced through proper schema design and constraints

## Confidentiality Controls

- **Data Classification**: All data classified according to sensitivity
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized services can access sensitive data
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of credentials via Secret Manager

## Privacy Controls

- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data collected and stored
- **Retention Policies**: Data only kept as long as necessary
- **Access Limitations**: Access to personal data restricted to authorized services
- **Data Processing Agreements**: Compliant agreements with all service providers

## Audit and Compliance Monitoring

Our infrastructure includes automated compliance monitoring:

1. **Security Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into security metrics
2. **Audit Log Analysis**: Regular review of audit logs for suspicious activity
3. **Alert Policies**: Immediate notification of potential compliance issues
4. **Regular Testing**: Automated scans and penetration testing

## Incident Response

Procedures are in place for responding to security incidents:

1. **Detection**: Automated detection through monitoring and alerts
2. **Containment**: Procedures to quickly isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Process for removing threats from the environment
4. **Recovery**: Steps to restore systems securely
5. **Post-incident Analysis**: Review and improvement process
