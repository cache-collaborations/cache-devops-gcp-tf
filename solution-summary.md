# Cache DevOps Take-Home Assessment: Solution Summary

## Overview

This solution provides a complete, production-grade infrastructure and application deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), meeting all requirements specified in the assessment. The implementation follows cloud best practices, security principles, and SOC 2 compliance guidelines.

## Key Components

### Infrastructure (Terraform)

1. **Network Infrastructure**
   - VPC network with separate staging and production subnets
   - Private GKE cluster with network policies
   - NAT gateway for egress traffic
   - Firewall rules with least privilege access

2. **Compute Resources**
   - GKE cluster with separate node pools for staging and production
   - Kubernetes namespaces for environment isolation
   - Bastion host for secure administrative access

3. **Data Storage**
   - Private Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
   - Secure connection via VPC peering

4. **Messaging**
   - Pub/Sub topic and subscription with retry policy

5. **Secrets Management**
   - Google Secret Manager for all sensitive information
   - IAM-based access control

6. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - ELK Stack deployed to GKE for centralized logging
   - Filebeat for container log collection
   - Logstash for log processing
   - Elasticsearch for log storage and search
   - Kibana for log visualization

### Application

1. **Features**
   - RESTful API with health endpoint
   - PostgreSQL database integration
   - Pub/Sub message publishing
   - Structured logging to ELK stack

2. **Architecture**
   - Containerized Python Flask application
   - Horizontally scalable (4+ nodes)
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - Health checks and probes

3. **Security**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Secure service account access via Workload Identity
   - Input validation and sanitization

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Automated testing, building, and deployment
   - Environment-specific deployments
   - Approval workflow for production

2. **Cloud Build**
   - Alternative pipeline option
   - Secure handling of secrets

## Security & Compliance

1. **Access Control**
   - Least privilege IAM roles
   - Service account separation
   - Workload Identity

2. **Network Security**
   - Network segmentation
   - Private cluster
   - Network policies

3. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Secure secret management

4. **Audit & Logging**
   - Comprehensive audit trails
   - Centralized logging
   - Bastion host access logging

5. **SOC 2 Alignment**
   - Security
   - Availability
   - Processing Integrity
   - Confidentiality
   - Privacy

## Implementation Notes

1. **Scalability**
   - Auto-scaling based on CPU utilization
   - Minimum 4 nodes in production
   - Separate node pools for staging and production

2. **Reliability**
   - Health checks and probes
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Error logging and monitoring

3. **Maintainability**
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
   - CI/CD automation
   - Comprehensive documentation

4. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Preemptible VMs for staging
   - Right-sized resources
   - Automatic scaling
