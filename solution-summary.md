# Cache DevOps Take-Home Assessment: Solution Summary

## Overview

This solution provides a complete, production-grade infrastructure and application deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), meeting all requirements specified in the assessment. The implementation follows cloud best practices, security principles, and SOC 2 compliance guidelines.

## Key Components

### Infrastructure (Terraform)

1. **Network Infrastructure**
   - VPC network with separate staging and production subnets
   - Private GKE cluster with network policies
   - NAT gateway for egress traffic
   - Firewall rules with least privilege access

2. **Compute Resources**
   - GKE cluster with separate node pools for staging and production
   - Kubernetes namespaces for environment isolation
   - Bastion host for secure administrative access

3. **Data Storage**
   - Private Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance
   - Secure connection via VPC peering

4. **Messaging**
   - Pub/Sub topic and subscription with retry policy

5. **Secrets Management**
   - Google Secret Manager for all sensitive information
   - IAM-based access control

6. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - ELK Stack deployed to GKE for centralized logging
   - Filebeat for container log collection
   - Logstash for log processing

   - Health checks and probes

3. **Security**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Secure service account access via Workload Identity
   - Input validation and sanitization

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Automated testing, building, and deployment
   - Environment-specific deployments
   - Approval workflow for production

2. **Cloud Build**
   - Alternative pipeline option
   - Secure handling of secrets

## Security & Compliance

4. **Audit & Logging**
   - Comprehensive audit trails
   - Centralized logging
   - Bastion host access logging

5. **SOC 2 Alignment**
   - Security
   - Availability
   - Processing Integrity
   - Confidentiality
   - Privacy
